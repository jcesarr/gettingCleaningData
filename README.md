Coursera Data Science course on Getting and Cleaning Data

This project contains the R script (run_analysis.R) that creates a tidy data set data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is located at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The data is located at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

In order to run the script and produce a tiny data set:
1. Unzip the compressed dataset file.
2. Put the run_analysis.R file inside the main folder (UCI HAR Dataset)
3. Run the run_analysis.R file, which will create a tidy_data.txt file

The produced data set contains the mean value of the columns that correspond to the mean and standard deviation per activity per user.
